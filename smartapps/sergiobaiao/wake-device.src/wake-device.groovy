 *
 *  To make this work, you need to follow this:
 *  1 - Create an account, if you don't have one, in the SmartThings Groovy IDE (https://graph.api.smartthings.com/)
 *  2 - Link your Smartthings Hub, if it's not already linked, your account.
 *  3 - Create a new SmartApp out of this code. Go to your "MySmartApps" page, click on the "New SmartApp" button, 
 *      choose "From Code", and then copy and paste the contents of this file there. Then click on "Create" button.
 *  4 - You now need to create a new Device Handler. Go to your "My Device Handlers" page, and click on "Create New Device Handler"
        button. Select the "From Code" option, then open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiobaiao/SmartThingsPublic/master/wakedevice/togglebutton.groovy 
		on your browser and copy and paste the code on the form, then click on the "Create" button
 *  4 - You now need to create a new Device that will control this SmartApp. Go to your "My Devices" page, click on
 *      the new "Create New Device" button, and follow this:
 *          Name: Put a name for the Toggle Button, like "Turn on Kitchen TV"
 *          Label: Put a label, can be the same as the Name
 *          Zigbee Id: leave blank
 *          Device Network ID: Give it an unique identifier, like "BUTWOLKTV"
 *          Type: Select "Toggle Button"
 *          Version: Published
 *          Location: Choose the Location where your Smartthings Hub is. If you don't have one yet, go back and create one
 *                    at "Locations" page. But you'll probably have one already, so, choose it.
 *          Hub: Choose your Smartthings Hub
 *          Group: Not available yet. After you create the Virtual Switch you can edit it and "move" it to a room using this.
 *      Now click on "Create" button. Your newly created Virtual Switch will be shown at your "Devices" Page.
 *   5 - Go back to your Smartthings app on your smartphone. Click on the 3 dash button on your top left, the choose SmartApps.
 *   6 - Click on the "+" button to add a new SmartApp
 *   7 - The SmartApp you previously created will be shown under "My SmartApps". Click on it, named "Wake Device"
 *   8 - Click On the "Choose a Switch" section, and choose the Virtual Switch you just created.
 *   9 - Under "MAC Address of device', input the device's MAC address in hexadecimal format, without any separators,
 *       like: aabbcc001122
 *   10 - Give this SmartApp instance a name, like "Wake Kitchen TV", then click Save.
 *   11 - A new switch will appear on your Dashboard. When you click on it, it will send a Magic Wake-on-Lan Packet to your device
 *        and, if everything is correctly configured (computers may need special configuration for this to work), your device will
 *        be turned on.
